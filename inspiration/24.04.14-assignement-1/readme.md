### Glossary

- #### Analog horror: 
A subgenre of horror that relies on retro or vintage technology aesthetics to create fear and unease.

- #### Backrooms: 
A fictional setting originating from internet lore, describing an endless series of interconnected empty rooms. These rooms are characterized by their nondescript, off-white walls and fluorescent lighting, evoking a sense of disorientation and existential dread. The Backrooms are often depicted as a surreal and unsettling environment where individuals may become lost or trapped, navigating through its seemingly infinite corridors in search of an exit.

- #### Breakcore: 
A genre of electronic music characterized by its fast and chaotic rhythms, often incorporating elements from various other genres.

- #### Creepy-pasta: 
Internet-based horror stories or urban legends, often spread through forums, social media, or email chains.

- #### Dungeon crawler: 
 A genre of video games where players navigate through maze-like environments, battling monsters, solving puzzles, and collecting loot. These games typically feature grid-based movement and emphasize exploration and combat within dungeon settings.

- #### EMF detector:
Electronic devices used to detect electromagnetic fields (EMFs), commonly associated with paranormal investigations and ghost hunting. They measure fluctuations in electromagnetic energy, believed by some to indicate the presence of spirits or supernatural phenomena.

- #### Liminal space: 
Transitional or in-between spaces that evoke a sense of disorientation or unease, often characterized by their ambiguity and lack of clear boundaries. These spaces can include abandoned buildings, empty corridors, or other environments that are neither fully occupied nor entirely deserted. Liminal spaces are often associated with feelings of suspense, mystery, and introspection, inviting contemplation on the thresholds between different states or realities.

- #### PSX: 
The visual style associated with the original PlayStation console (often abbreviated as PSX), characterized by polygonal graphics, low-resolution textures, and distinctive hardware limitations. This aesthetic is nostalgic for its retro gaming charm and encompasses a range of graphical qualities, including pixelation, flat shading, and limited color palettes, evoking a sense of nostalgia for the early days of 3D gaming.

- #### SCP: 
Stands for "Secure, Contain, Protect." It refers to a collaborative writing project and fictional universe centered around a fictional organization known as the SCP Foundation. This organization is tasked with securing and containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena that defy natural laws, often posing significant threats to humanity if left unchecked.

- #### Soulslike: 
 A subgenre of action role-playing games inspired by the gameplay mechanics and difficulty of the Souls series, typically featuring challenging combat, intricate level design, and a dark, atmospheric world filled with interconnected environments and lore.

- #### Ugly 3D: 
A term referring to intentionally low-quality or primitive 3D graphics, often used for stylistic or nostalgic purposes, evoking a sense of charm or authenticity reminiscent of early video game visuals.

- #### Y2K aesthetic:
The visual and cultural style of the late 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by a blend of futuristic and retro elements, vibrant colors, and digital-inspired designs, reflecting the anticipation and uncertainty surrounding the turn of the millennium.
