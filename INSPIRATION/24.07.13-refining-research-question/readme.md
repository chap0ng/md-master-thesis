**The first research question I had in mind was : " How do community-driven map cartography influence the development, longevity, and player engagement in video games ? "**

This question is in a way too general,  too vague for the process i'm trying to develop.

I would like to go deeper into the making process of these "amateur" maps as I think would be the main focus of my thesis.

It could be interesting to merge it with the question of video game archives, as more and more of video games gets lost through time or are really expensive to get as a player. 

How do these community perceive their work as a process of helping others but also are they aware of their work being a valuable archiving resource ?

**What is cartography in video games for me ? :**

For my bachelor thesis, I focused on "The Sound Design in Contemporary 3D Worlds," exploring the process of creating sound as a fundamental aspect of digital world-building. I explored sound design and Foley effects in video games, art installations, and artistic short films, and how these elements contribute to the creation of tangible and immersive worlds.

For me, video game cartography extends my research on virtual worlds and serves as an important gameplay element that deepens players' immersion. It provides a schematic representation of these worlds, condensing all their essential components and informations into a cohesive whole.

There are various types of maps and methods for creating them in video games, each influenced by the genre of the game. For instance, a roguelike game presents maps differently than a racing game. Some games, such as fighting games, may not feature in-game maps at all, opting instead for small levels designed created for visual diversity and storytelling.

The introduction of Marie Foulston in the "Videgame Atlas" resonated with my way of perceiving these maps. This paragraph state something important that i would like to dive deeper into : 

*" Interrogating and understanding these sites of shared digital heritage is not just fascinating but essential. Even if these digital space are seemingly ephemeral, they are still real. We have played in them, moved through them, explored them; they are places where we have died and been reborn, places we have both destroyed and co-created. These are places we have lived."*

This resonates with the question of why people become so obsessed with creating cartography while playing games. It helps players connect with the game world. When maps are absent or lack secret information, creating maps becomes the only way to delve deeper into the digital worlds we enjoy inhabiting.

I would like to talk about the internet community that create unofficial maps for old or new video games. About their process and point of view on virtual world archives.

How do amateur map makers contribute to the preservation and archiving of video games, especially those at risk of being lost or becoming prohibitively expensive for players?

- **Impact of Unofficial Maps on Digital Game Archives:** 
In what ways do unofficial, community-created maps aid in the archiving and preservation of video game worlds, and what effects do they have on documenting digital heritage?

- **Community Perceptions and Motivations in Video Game Cartography:** 
How do online communities view their role in producing unofficial maps for video games, and what drives their participation in this process? Are they conscious of the archival significance of their work?

- **Methodologies of Amateur Map Creation:** 
What are the processes and techniques employed by amateur cartographers in creating maps for video games, and how do these approaches vary across different genres and platforms?


**Synthesis:**

Combining these leads to this research question:

#### **How does community-driven cartography contribute to the preservation and archiving of digital game worlds, and what are the motivations, methodologies, and impacts on the documentation of digital heritage?**
