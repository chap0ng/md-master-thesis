# Research Question State 1 :

## - How do community-driven map cartography influence the development, longevity, and player engagement in video games ? -

####

## Why ? :

Video-game map guides and cartographers are a niche community of passionate. I'm aiming with this thesis to explore their practices, from modding to hand-drawing these maps, in an attempt to better understand their craft and dedication toward virtual worlds.

Modern triple-A games have transformed the nature of in-game maps, often revealing every point of interest and detail to the players. However, this comprehensive approach can actually diminish the sense of discovery within digital worlds, the story telling or even the gameplay itself.

---

The 3 main focal points of this subject : 

### Community :

- What motivates players to create and share their own maps?
- What tools are used in digital cartography as a player ?
- How accessible are these tools for the average player versus experienced modders ?
- How does these community work together ?
- For how long have these community been working on theses maps ?
- Why is it important to map virtual worlds ? (Archive ?, Hidden Storytelling ?, etc ... )
- Is it still something relevant to modern video-games due to "Ubisoftification" ?
- What roles do collaboration and competition play in these communities?
- How does video game cartography can create art pieces ?

### Makers :

- How are maps thought of ?
- How to use maps as an immersive tool ?
- How to use maps as a storytelling tool ?
- What makes a good/interesting map ?
- Why are contemporary video-game maps so empty ?
- Why does contemporary video-game maps hide less and less secrets in favour of showing everything ?
- How does map making impact game development ?

### Games :

- How can I join a digital cartographer community ?
- What game should I try to cartograph ?
- What is the main process when building a video-game map ?
- What are the different types of video-game maps ?
- How does From-software games brought back the old school maps ?
- How can cartography influence the player community ?
- The different art form of video-game map making (from modding to hand drawn).

# Research Plan & Methodology :

####

### 1. Interviews : 

Interviews of different people in digital cartography communities & interviews of game creators about the current state of map making.
Interviews will mostly be online or even on VR-Chat.

Interview methodology for digital cartographers: [Link](https://github.com/chap0ng/md-master-thesis/tree/main/METHOD/24.05.26-interview-comunity)

Interview methodology for game creators: [Link](https://github.com/chap0ng/md-master-thesis/tree/main/METHOD/24.05.29-interview-game-dev)

Cartographers communities list: [Link](https://github.com/chap0ng/md-master-thesis/tree/main/DATA/24.05.16-communities-list)
##

### 2. Content Analysis : 

Examination of the different types and themes of maps created by the community & examination of different types of games and what they produces in map making.

##
### 3. Case studies :

Analysing specific games with big communities ( From Software games, Skyrim, Silent Hill or so ...)

##
### 4. Videogame cartography & participative observation: 

Taking part myself in the creation of a video-game map guide in a game that interest me or even better that hasn't been mapped before. Doing it with either the direct help of a community or by chatting with them on methodologies.

# First Outputs : 

- The video-games inventory !

- Tried reaching my Instagram community -> I got reach by some people that weren't in the field but did gave me contacts that I will be able to reach.

- Got in contact with the game dev [Miller Klitsner](https://millerklitsner.com/) who've sent a general call on his game dev discord server to see if some people are interested in doing tiny interviews.

- Talked to [Plastiboo](https://www.instagram.com/plastiboo/) (amazing artist !) -> Answer, but never did a digital map making, rather an artist and storyteller (they did amazing imaginary game maps for Vermis). Told me to try reaching [Sinclair Lore](https://www.youtube.com/@SinclairLore/featured) that did a huge project on from software maps and wikis.

- Tried reaching [ALT236](https://www.youtube.com/@ALT236) after his last video that had chapters about making a video game cartography -> No answer yet on Instagram, but i'll write to him also on other platform.

---
# Next Steps :

- Reaching out to the [Spriter Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) community.

- Reaching out [Sinclair Lore](https://www.youtube.com/@SinclairLore/featured) about From Software maps mechanics (for Bloodborn or Elden Ring).

- Choosing a game I will be doing cartography for.

- Video-games inventory completion.
