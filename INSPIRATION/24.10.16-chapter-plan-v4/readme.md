### **Chapter 2: FromSoftware's "Meta Game" Case Study (Maybe something else that is a result on amateur maps, because of the changes some game did or not ) (Results ?) (presentation du case study ) (peut aussi être synthèse/ résumé dans le point 1.4 dans ma méthode qui est un impulse ) ( matière brute / donnée brut )**

**2.1 Influence of FromSoftware's games on Map Perception**

- Analysis of how Elden Ring’s map design has influenced player expectations and experiences.
- Role of community-driven maps in shaping the understanding of the game’s world.
- How the meta game of Elden Ring bring back old school external gameplay.

**2.2 Implications for video-game archives**

- How From Software's game map designs contribute to the broader understanding of archiving digital games.
- The role of innovative mapping techniques in preserving the significance of video game worlds.

### **Chapter 3: The Role of Community-Driven Cartography as a part of meta-game // Motivations, Methodologies, and Impact of Amateur Cartographers (How?)**

#### ~~3.1 Digital worlds Preservation~~

- ~~Challenges in preserving digital content, especially video-games.~~

#### 3.2 Cartography in Video Games ( & in real life ?)

- Role of maps in video games.
- Context of amateur contributions to digital content.
- Parallel evolution of in-game and amateur (external) video-game maps.

#### 3.3 Overview of Community-Driven Cartography

- Definition and examples of community-driven maps and their forums.
- Comparison with official game maps.
##### Amateur Map Topologies & Classification process

- **Hand-Drawn Maps**
    - Characteristics and significance of hand-drawn maps.
    - Examples and notable cases.
- **Digital Renderings**
    - Overview of digital mapping tools and software.
    - Comparisons between different digital approaches.
- **Hybrid Maps**
    - Combination of traditional and digital techniques.
    - Case studies and their impact.

1. "Explicit maps" : Maps used as a basic world reference. No annotation or extra work (ex: Copy of in game maps / collages)

2. Optimization Maps : that are used as a broader mechanic purpose. (ex: for speed runs or ressources farming)

3. Personal/ hand drawn maps : that has been made for someone's own puzzle or game journey, that could be found in paper sheets or in notebooks. (ex: hand drawn maps with notes or so)

4. Road maps/ Explorations maps : showing a narrative path and how to complete a game 100%. Help finding all the nooks and cranny.

5. Maps that are interactive and community based : ( ex: these are the work of many people online building it together with different tools)

#### 3.4 Interviews insight (Community Perceptions and Engagement)

- Methodology and selection criteria for interviewing digital cartographers.
- Key insights from interviews with amateur and professional map creators.
- Perspectives on motivations, challenges, and perceptions of their work.
- Personal and communal reasons behind map creation.
- Case studies of individual and group motivations.

- How amateur cartographers view their role and contributions.
- Awareness of the archival value of their work.
- Influence of map creation on community involvement and engagement.
- Insights from interviews on how map creation affects community dynamics.

#### 3.5 Processes and Techniques With Case Studies

- Common methods and tools used in amateur map making.
- Differences in techniques across various game genres.
- Detailed analysis of notable community-driven maps.
- Impact on the preservation and perception of specific video games.

- Challenges faced by amateur cartographers.
- Innovative solutions and practices in map creation.

#### ~~3.6 Impact on Archiving and Documentation~~

- ~~How community-created maps contribute to digital archiving efforts.~~
- ~~Integration of maps into existing archival frameworks.~~
- ~~Role of maps in documenting the evolution of digital game worlds.~~
- ~~Long-term impact on the historical record of video games.~~
- ~~Strategies for preserving community-driven maps and their role in preserving ephemeral digital content.~~
