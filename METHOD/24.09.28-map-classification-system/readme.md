# --- Map Classification System ---

---

### Starting Point :

As a starting point to create this classification system, i'm basing my research on the point of view of Mciver Lopes book "Philosophy of Computer Art" and mixing it with the written theory of Metagames by Richard Garfield.

McIver Lopes mostly classifies computer art on interaction, algorithms and user participation. These help acknowledge the diversity inside this field and how the medium work technically and how users can experiences and define the medium. 

He stand these points as classification criteria inside computer created art :
#### - 1 : Algorithmic Art :

One of Lopes Key Classification, which he defines as art where algorithms play a big role in the creation of a computer created art piece. It mainly focuses on the process, where the artist creates programs or use them to execute an algorithm that generate art work. (In a way today NFT's and AI art like mid journey creates, could be seen as algorithmic art too.) 

**Exemples** : P5/Processing generated art, Fractals, Procedural landscapes in video games, many NFT like bored apes, Midjourney, Some sound/art installations (ex: Ian Cheng's Emissaries), ...

- **Code as creation** : Main focus of this process, where artist build or use programs that create the work. 

- **Autonomy** : Makes the program runs after it's creation and automatically generate with few manipulation from the artist.

- **Generative** : Could be seen as a subcategory. Where the code produce multiple iteration based on randomisation , wich make it evolve in time or that can be re-created under different conditions.

#### - 2 : Interactive Art :

When a computer generated art is interactive, it means for Mciver Lopes that the viewer or participant plays a direct role in the final form or experience of the artwork. The viewers then challenges the traditional ideas of authors as they becomes co-creators.

**Exemples** : Art Installations that shapes itself with the users (Ex: Ian Cheng's BOB), Video games, some online guide maps that you can add markers on, ...

- **Dynamic experiences** : Meaning that unlike other traditional art-forms like paintings or sculptures, the art can change, vary, with each engagement. Each user experiences of the same work will be slightly different.

- **Real-time** : The artwork is shaped through user action, so the final appearance or behaviour of the work is shaped by the viewers choices.

- **Multiple authorship / Ownership** : The author setup an idea/playground that cannot bring it's full potential without the active role of the viewers/audience.

#### - 3 : Digital Art : 

Digital art is a larger classification he made, it includes all art pieces that are using digital technologies in their conception. It includes algorithmic and interactive work but can also be involved in neither of these.

**exemples** : Photo manipulation (Photoshop), Digital paintings, Vector art, pixel art, 3D modeling, 3D or digital animations, ...

- **Medium** : It is the key to define digital art, as the artwork must be created, stored or display using a computer or digital related tools.

- **Dynamic** : These can be static or moving but does not rely, like interactive art, on the viewers to be complete or experienced. It is similar to traditional art form but created with digital technologies.

- **Output** : It rely on it's virtual nature and code-based existence, making it a structure of data and pixels as the art piece final output.

___
#### - 4 : Immersive Art :

This Category involves environments that are digitally created that envelopes the viewers. The viewers experience the artwork through his senses and as if they where inside these digital environments.

**Exemples** : Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), ...

- **Environmental interaction** : User can often affect their surroundings or navigate trough virtual spaces.

- **Immersive** : The viewers is immersed in partial or total environment that is digital created, making it more multi-sensorial.

#### - 5 : Hybrid ? :

In a way, Lopes explain that computer art can often be hybrid, combining different types of making processes and viewers interactions. This makes computer art flexible and adaptable in the field of art creation.
