# --- Map Classification System ---

---

### Starting Point :

As a starting point to create this classification system, i'm basing my research on the point of view of Mciver Lopes book "Philosophy of Computer Art" and mixing it with the written theory of Metagames by Richard Garfield.

McIver Lopes mostly classifies computer art on interaction, algorithms and user participation. These help acknowledge the diversity inside this field and how the medium work technically and how users can experiences and define the medium. 

He stand these points as classification criteria inside computer created art :
#### - 1 : Algorithmic Art :

One of Lopes Key Classification, which he defines as art where algorithms play a big role in the creation of a computer created art piece. It mainly focuses on the process, where the artist creates programs or use them to execute an algorithm that generate art work. (In a way today NFT's and AI art like mid journey creates, could be seen as algorithmic art too.) 

**Exemples** : P5/Processing generated art, Fractals, Procedural landscapes in video games, many NFT like bored apes, Midjourney, Some sound/art installations (ex: Ian Cheng's Emissaries), ...

- **Code as creation** : Main focus of this process, where artist build or use programs that create the work. 

- **Autonomy** : Makes the program runs after it's creation and automatically generate with few manipulation from the artist.

- **Generative** : Could be seen as a subcategory. Where the code produce multiple iteration based on randomisation , wich make it evolve in time or that can be re-created under different conditions.

#### - 2 : Interactive Art :

When a computer generated art is interactive, it means for Mciver Lopes that the viewer or participant plays a direct role in the final form or experience of the artwork. The viewers then challenges the traditional ideas of authors as they becomes co-creators.

**Exemples** : Art Installations that shapes itself with the users (Ex: Ian Cheng's BOB), Video games, some online guide maps that you can add markers on, ...

- **Dynamic experiences** : Meaning that unlike other traditional art-forms like paintings or sculptures, the art can change, vary, with each engagement. Each user experiences of the same work will be slightly different.

- **Real-time** : The artwork is shaped through user action, so the final appearance or behaviour of the work is shaped by the viewers choices.

- **Multiple authorship / Ownership** : The author setup an idea/playground that cannot bring it's full potential without the active role of the viewers/audience.

#### - 3 : Digital Art : 

Digital art is a larger classification he made, it includes all art pieces that are using digital technologies in their conception. It includes algorithmic and interactive work but can also be involved in neither of these.

**exemples** : Photo manipulation (Photoshop), Digital paintings, Vector art, pixel art, 3D modeling, 3D or digital animations, ...

- **Medium** : It is the key to define digital art, as the artwork must be created, stored or display using a computer or digital related tools.

- **Dynamic** : These can be static or moving but does not rely, like interactive art, on the viewers to be complete or experienced. It is similar to traditional art form but created with digital technologies.

- **Output** : It rely on it's virtual nature and code-based existence, making it a structure of data and pixels as the art piece final output.

___
#### - 4 : Immersive Art :

This Category involves environments that are digitally created that envelopes the viewers. The viewers experience the artwork through his senses and as if they where inside these digital environments.

**Exemples** : Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), ...

- **Environmental interaction** : User can often affect their surroundings or navigate trough virtual spaces.

- **Immersive** : The viewers is immersed in partial or total environment that is digital created, making it more multi-sensorial.

#### - 5 : Hybrid ? :

In a way, Lopes explain that computer art can often be hybrid, combining different types of making processes and viewers interactions. This makes computer art flexible and adaptable in the field of art creation.

### How could Meta-Gaming and Guide maps fits inside Lopes Classification ? :

In a way Meta-Gaming is part of the games but does it make it important to archive for further research ? Do we need to focus mainly on game preservation ? or should we also archive these in an attempt to understand how these where played and loved ? 

Aren't these maps like a picture or a specific rediffusion of a performance, making it linked to it's base materials as much as being it's own "art" ? So are these creators digital artists too ? How does performance art rediffusion is seen in the field of galleries ?

These questions comes in mind;

**Can a guide maps be algorithmic ? :** 

Might not but there's a way to link this in a way. Some games like no man sky or Minecraft are based on algorithmic and generative maps. This category could be used to know how maps work in a static or procedural system.

**Are they Interactive ? :**

Are the maps selected interactive ? Can you add to them through your computer ? 

or

How does the maps bring more interactivity with the game or in the opposite side constrain the players perspective ?

**and how do user engage with them ?:**

Is the purpose of the map exploration ? Speed run ? enhancing game mechanics ? abstract ? or just pure layout of the game ?

---

Maps would also need to be categorised trough their **purpose** and **how** **they've been crafted**. For exemple some are hand-made, some delivers info on items, some on lore and even some are just a collage of multiple screenshot making it more understandable to navigate these virtual worlds.

I also need to know if these are for sharing purpose/ **community based** ? or are they **personal** ? 


##### With these in mind here's my first attempt at creating my base guide maps categories : 

1. "Explicit maps" : Maps used as a basic world reference. No annotation or extra work (ex: Copy of in game maps / collages)

2. Maps that are used as a broader mechanic purpose. (ex: for speed runs or for lore )

3. Maps that are personal, that has been made for someone's own puzzle or game journey. (ex: hand drawn maps with notes or so)

4. Road maps, showing a narrative path and to complete a game 100%. 

5. Maps that are interactive and community based. ( ex: these are the work of many people online building it together with different tools)

##### Questions i need to ask myself :

-What tools did they used ?

-For what purpose ?

-How can these be related to computer art or gameplay ?
