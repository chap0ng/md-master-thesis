# --- Map Classification System ---

---

### Starting Point :

As a starting point to create this classification system, i'm basing my research on the point of view of Mciver Lopes book "Philosophy of Computer Art" and mixing it with the written theory of Metagames by Richard Garfield.

McIver Lopes mostly classifies computer art on interaction, algorithms and user participation.

He stand these points as classification criteria inside computer created art :

#### - 1 : Algorithmic Art :

One of Lopes Key Classification, which he defines as art where algorithms play a big role in the creation of a computer created art piece. It mainly focuses on the process, where the artist creates programs or use them to execute an algorithm that generate art work. (In a way today NFT's and AI art like mid journey creates, could be seen as algorithmic art too.) 

**Possible exemples** : P5/Processing generated art, Fractals, Procedural landscapes in video games, many NFT like bored apes, Midjourney, Some sound/art installations (ex: Ian Cheng's Emissaries), ...

- **Code as creation** : Main focus of this process, where artist build or use programs that create the work. 

- **Autonomy** : Makes the program runs after it's creation and automatically generate with few manipulation from the artist.

- **Generative** : Could be seen as a subcategory. Where the code produce multiple iteration based on randomisation , wich make it evolve in time or that can be re-created under different conditions.

#### - 2 : Interactive Art :

When a computer generated art is interactive, it means for Mciver Lopes that the viewer or participant plays a direct role in the final form or experience of the artwork. The viewers then challenges the traditional ideas of authors as they becomes co-creators.

**Possible exemples** : Art Installations that shapes itself with the users (Ex: Ian Cheng's BOB), Video games, some online guide maps that you can add markers on, ...

- **Dynamic experiences** : Meaning that unlike other traditional art-forms like paintings or sculptures, the art can change, vary, with each engagement. Each user experiences of the same work will be slightly different.

- **Real-time** : The artwork is shaped through user action, so the final appearance or behaviour of the work is shaped by the viewers choices.

- **Multiple authorship / Ownership** : The author setup an idea/playground that cannot bring it's full potential without the active role of the viewers/audience.
