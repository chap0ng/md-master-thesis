# --- Map Classification System ---

### Starting Point :

As a starting point to create this classification system, i'm basing my research on the point of view of McIver Lopes book "Philosophy of Computer Art" and mixing it with the written theory of Metagames by Richard Garfield.

McIver Lopes mostly classifies computer art on interaction, algorithms and user participation.

He stand these points as classification criteria inside computer created art :

#### - 1 : Algorithmic Art :

One of Lopes Key Classification, which he defines as art where algorithms play a big role in the creation of a computer created art piece. It mainly focuses on the process, where the artist creates programs or use them to execute an algorithm that generate art work. (In a way today NFT's and AI art like mid journey creates, could be seen as algorithmic art too.)

- Code as creation : Main focus of this process, where artist build or use programs that create the work. 

- Autonomy : Makes the program runs after it's creation and automatically generate with few manipulation from the artist.

- Generative : Could be seen as a subcategory. Where the code produce multiple iteration based on randomisation , wich make it evolve in time or that can be re-created under different conditions.
