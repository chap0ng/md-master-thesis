# --- Map Classification System V2 ---

### As previously mentioned in the classification v1 here are the first conclusions.

---
### How could Meta-Gaming and Guide maps fits inside Lopes Classification ? :

In a way Meta-Gaming is part of the games but does it make it important to archive for further research ? Do we need to focus mainly on game preservation ? or should we also archive these in an attempt to understand how these where played and loved ? 

Aren't these maps like a picture or a specific rediffusion of a performance, making it linked to it's base materials as much as being it's own "art" ? So are these creators digital artists too ? How does performance art rediffusion is seen in the field of galleries ?

These questions comes in mind;

**Can a guide maps be algorithmic ? :** 

Might not but there's a way to link this in a way. Some games like no man sky or Minecraft are based on algorithmic and generative maps. This category could be used to know how maps work in a static or procedural system.

**Are they Interactive ? :**

Are the maps selected interactive ? Can you add to them through your computer ? 

or

How does the maps bring more interactivity with the game or in the opposite side constrain the players perspective ?

**and how do user engage with them ?:**

Is the purpose of the map exploration ? Speed run ? enhancing game mechanics ? abstract ? or just pure layout of the game ?

Maps would also need to be categorised trough their **purpose** and **how** **they've been crafted**. For exemple some are hand-made, some delivers info on items, some on lore and even some are just a collage of multiple screenshot making it more understandable to navigate these virtual worlds.

I also need to know if these are for sharing purpose/ **community based** ? or are they **personal** ? 


#### With these in mind here's my first attempt at creating my base guide maps categories : 

1. "Explicit maps" : Maps used as a basic world reference. No annotation or extra work (ex: Copy of in game maps / collages)

2. Maps that are used as a broader mechanic purpose. (ex: for speed runs or for lore )

3. Maps that are personal, that has been made for someone's own puzzle or game journey. (ex: hand drawn maps with notes or so)

4. Road maps, showing a narrative path and to complete a game 100%. 

5. Maps that are interactive and community based. ( ex: these are the work of many people online building it together with different tools)

#### Here's how i refined it as the number 2 and 4 seems too similar to me : 

1. "Explicit maps" : Maps used as a basic world reference. No annotation or extra work (ex: Copy of in game maps / collages)

2. Optimization Maps : that are used as a broader mechanic purpose. (ex: for speed runs or ressources farming)

3. Personal/ hand drawn maps : that has been made for someone's own puzzle or game journey, that could be found in paper sheets or in notebooks. (ex: hand drawn maps with notes or so)

4. Road maps/ Explorations maps : showing a narrative path and how to complete a game 100%. Help finding all the nooks and cranny.

5. Maps that are interactive and community based : ( ex: these are the work of many people online building it together with different tools)

### I would now like to compare it and see if i could use Ross Thorn map system to complete it further or as a tool of comparaison. 

Ross Thorn made a Thesis about "Playful Maps" in video games and made a system to grade them called the 4 "i" system that he now use in Stamen Blog to classify and "grade" game maps : 

The posts are named "Cartographers Play Video Games - a review of ..."

He's been using his system since many years, first one i have now found date from 2022 and was used as a critique tool for Elden Ring's map.

In his text about  Zelda BOTW he states it so :

RT: Exactly! In [my research](http://bit.ly/RTthesis), I laid out those four “i” words as pillars of playful cartography:

- **Interactive:** playful maps allow for the user to change the map through interaction with the map directly or through actions by the player-controlled avatar in the virtual world.
- **Immersive:** playful maps are easy and fun to use as map artifacts, but also immerse the user in the story and setting of the game through a variety of aesthetic and experiential design decisions.
- **Incomplete:** playful maps encourage exploration and gameplay by not showing all the possible information and driving the player to unlock more information by playing the game.
- **Interpersonal:** play is often social in nature. Maps that support play in multiplayer games are interpersonal and serve as a communication device between players to help them achieve their goals.


mixing it with my system i could use it as so :

- **Interactive:** Could be used in how players interacts or modify their maps, the concept of interactivity play a big role on how meta-gaming is used by creating specific maps and on the participatory nature of these. It could also be seen as something similar to community based maps where players talk to each other and use online tools to complete bigger challenges such as Fextralife Elden Ring's maps.

This can mostly be linked with my Community-Based Maps and Optimization Maps categories.

- **Immersive:** Explicit naps and Road maps are often the tools for impressiveness too. They help players complete games but also to deepen their connections to different games stories and world-building. 

This can mostly be linked with my Road Maps/Exploration Maps and Explicit Maps categories.

- **Incomplete:** Many of in-game maps are incomplete by design. Trying to hide to the players and are often made as a tool of basic navigation. They encourage the player to explore and discover more. This concept can be applied to some more abstract guide maps too as they are often schematics. It can also be used to get better understanding on what players seeks and their journey through these virtual worlds.

This can mostly be linked with my Personal/Hand Drawn Maps category.

- **Interpersonal:** Community-created maps often serve a social fonction, they act as collaborative creations that are shared upon by many players. They serve the social dynamics of gaming communities. 

This can mostly be linked with all of my categories except maybe personal ones.
