### Chapter 1 : AC unity

talks about how a game can re create historical monuments and use them as part of the gameplay

They're using the 18th century Paris's building as part of the game mechanics. Re creating them as most accurately as possible but in a way that facilitate players movements.

The major historical monuments in Paris provides key reference points for AC:Unity's world.

The rest of paris is proceduraly generated, making it possible to use a fluid movement on the rooftops that are one of the most significant point of the game and recreate an approximation of Paris urbanism. 

The developers compressed Paris using what they called "radial scaling" using notre dame de paris as the center point (book fig 7).

The whole maps and object used to travel from rooftops to another are seen with the lenses of someone that does parkour. The houses and ground floor used for daily life switches with Paris rooftops, that are usually not for many people to walk on.

The map is carefully crafted mixing procedural and carefully placed parcours elements to create a flow allowing the player to rapidly go from point A to point B in the city of paris.

Assasin's screed unity also shape it's space with how the crowd of NPC is placed through the map.

They've simulated crowd movement with data analysis using Space Syntax ( academic/industry partnership based in london, that are analysing urban spaces)

These provide invisible walls and stealth for the player to evade the ennemies and guards.
