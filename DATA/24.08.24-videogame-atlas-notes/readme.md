Dev info but most of the books info came from players, Discord channel, Reddit, games wiki, YouTube clips,...


### Chapter 1 : AC unity

talks about how a game can re create historical monuments and use them as part of the gameplay

They're using the 18th century Paris's building as part of the game mechanics. Re creating them as most accurately as possible but in a way that facilitate players movements.

The major historical monuments in Paris provides key reference points for AC:Unity's world.

The rest of paris is proceduraly generated, making it possible to use a fluid movement on the rooftops that are one of the most significant point of the game and recreate an approximation of Paris urbanism. 

The developers compressed Paris using what they called "radial scaling" using notre dame de paris as the center point (book fig 7).

The whole maps and object used to travel from rooftops to another are seen with the lenses of someone that does parkour. The houses and ground floor used for daily life switches with Paris rooftops, that are usually not for many people to walk on.

The map is carefully crafted mixing procedural and carefully placed parcours elements to create a flow allowing the player to rapidly go from point A to point B in the city of paris.

Assasin's screed unity also shape it's space with how the crowd of NPC is placed through the map.

They've simulated crowd movement with data analysis using Space Syntax ( academic/industry partnership based in london, that are analysing urban spaces)

These provide invisible walls and stealth for the player to evade the ennemies and guards.

### Chapter 2 : Cities Skylines

(readed 24.08.31)

###### 2.1

The game has grown with the help of a big modding community and uses Unity engine.
Player population as in 2021 = 265'000

In the vanilla game, a popular map by user "Fluxburgh", is one of the most used pre-made city.
The city presents itself through the "God view mode" and look very alike a real city but is somewhat more compressed.

The game present itself like a "major" simulation where you create your city and manage ressources.

The vanilla maps offers 5x5 tiles to the player for a total of 92,16m2 of possible map area.
( = to the size of Zurich)

Para 4 P:35 "(...) Each map comes with its own challenges and opportunities through features such as undulating terrain, coastline, climate and raw materials, which might not fall within the immediately playable area of the map. As a result, the community considers some base maps to be easier than others, setting the scene for a well-balanced city. (...)  "

The game has also been referenced and played by real-life urban planner.
But making it difficult in terms the type of society it promotes.
(kind of challenging to create a socialist city in the game)

Interesting game for what it generate alongside communities both within the game and outside.

###### 2.2

City Skylines uses the urban model of zoning, to designate part of the cities for particular functions. This principle is used by many countries but the games has it's variant of "non-hierarchical zoning". 

Daniel Lobo describes this as "a reflection of the most extreme tendencies of development in the USA" (Ref P 41)

The game upgrades it's building by destroying the old ones to make the level up version, this shows a tendency of hyper-intensified version of property development trends. It is not following the historical housing stock.

The game's communities have developed guides to subvert the system, allowing for more authentic low rise buildings. 

P:42 - fig 5 & 6 - Community technique to change the game building systems.

The economic and regulations logic of today cities are paralleled in the game 

###### 2.3

" Population density is tied to the area of the city, reaching new milestones to expand from a little hamlet to a full-blown Megapolis."

from 120-480 to 20'000-90'000

the rest of the chapter is about the "Cims" (virtual habitant of the game / NPC).

P:50 - fig 11 - Top ten user-created base maps, ...

###### 2.4

The base game give the option to make American or European country.

Some DLC add different elements to the game like disasters or green cities.

But the interesting stuffs lies within the connection to Steam Workshops and the community  home brew extensions.

This shows what the community wants and their interests.

You can "subscribe" to download the content from Steam Workshop, allowing the players to add maps or even cosmetics (building styles).

Most of the cosmetics blends fantasy and realistic visuals.
